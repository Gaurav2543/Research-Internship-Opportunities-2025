Note: This list is made with a focus on the European Region and while it covers almost all the opportunities open to international students in Europe and UK, the list for opportunities in America is very limited and requires further exploration. Please note that the application deadlines may change for years to follow in the future. You can check the official websites for the most up-to-date information. CG-cutoff values are out of 10.
